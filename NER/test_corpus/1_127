HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [** Name **] returns today for followup visit for his epistaxis.  This patient was followed while inpatient by Dr. [** Name **] and myself. I have replaced his inflatable Rhinorocket with an 8 cm Merocel on Friday.  The patient returns today for removal of the aforementioned packing.  He is treated with anticoagulation and aspirin for underlying coagulopathy and previous DVT. That has been discontinued.  His current INR is running about 1.0.  
  
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, the patient is in no acute distress.  There was no bleeding in the oropharynx.  The nasal packing was removed without difficulty.  The nasal vault was then suctioned and there was no further bleeding.  The patient was kept in the office for about 15 minutes with no further bleeding.  
  
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  I have extensively discussed nosebleed precautions with him, particularly those involving decreased activity, humidification, hydration and abstaining from nasal projectiles.  
  
  
  
I discussed the case with the nurse practitioner and/or physician assistant and agree with the findings and plan as documented in the note.
